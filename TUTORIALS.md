## Tutorials
If you aren't familiar with the semantic.works stack/microservices yet, you might want to check out [why semantic tech?](https://github.com/mu-semtech/project/blob/master/docs/discussions/why-semantic-tech.md)

Each of these tutorials starts with a mu-project docker-compose set-up.

### Creating a JSON API 
Repetition is boring. Web applications oftentimes require the same functionality: to create, read, update and delete resources. Even if they operate in different domains. Or, in terms of a REST API, endpoints to GET, POST, PATCH and DELETE resources. Since productivity is one of the driving forces behind the mu.semte.ch architecture, the platform provides a microservice ‚Äì [mu-cl-resources](https://github.com/mu-semtech/mu-cl-resources) ‚Äì that generates a [JSONAPI](http://jsonapi.org/) compliant API for your resources based on a simple configuration describing the domain. In this tutorial we will explain how to setup such a configuration.

#### Adding mu-cl-resources to your project
Like all microservices in the mu.semte.ch stack, mu-cl-resources is published as a Docker image. It just needs two configuration files in `./config/resources/`:

- `domain.lisp`: describing the resources and relationships between them in your domain
- `repository.lisp`: defining prefixes for the vocabularies used in your domain

To provide the configuration files, you can mount the files in the /config folder of the Docker image:
```yaml
services:
  # ...
  resource:
    image: semtech/mu-cl-resources:1.20.0
    links:
      - database:database
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config
  # ...
```
Alternatively you can build your own Docker image by extending the mu-cl-resources image and copying the configuration files in /config. See the [mu-cl-resources repo](https://github.com/mu-semtech/mu-cl-resources#mounting-the-config-files).

The former option may be easier during development, while the latter is better suited in a production environment. With this last variant you can publish and release your service with its own version, independent of the mu-cl-resources version.

When adding mu-cl-resources to our application, we also have to update the dispatcher configuration such that incoming requests get dispatched to our new service. We will update the dispatcher configuration at the end of this tutorial once we know on which endpoints our resources will be available.

#### Describing your domain
Next step is to describe your domain in the configuration files. The configuration is written in Common Lisp. Don‚Äôt be intimidated, just follow the examples, make abstraction of all the parentheses and your‚Äôre good to go üôÇ As an example, we will describe the domain of the [ember-data-table demo](http://ember-data-table.semte.ch/) which [consists of books and their authors](https://github.com/erikap/books-service/tree/ember-data-table-example).

##### repository.lisp
The `repository.lisp` file describes the prefixes for the vocabularies used in our domain model.

To start, each configuration file starts with:

```lisp
(in-package :mu-cl-resources)
```

Next, the prefixes are listed one per line as follows:

```lisp
(in-package :mu-cl-resources)

(add-prefix "dcterms" "http://purl.org/dc/terms/")
(add-prefix "schema" "http://schema.org/")
```

##### domain.lisp
The domain.lisp file describes your resources and the relationships between them. In this post we will describe the model of a book. Later on we will add an author model and specify the relationship between books and authors.

Also start the `domain.lisp` file with the following line:
```lisp
(in-package :mu-cl-resources)
```

Next, add the basis of the book model:
```lisp
(in-package :mu-cl-resources)

(define-resource book ()
  :class (s-prefix "schema:Book")
  :resource-base (s-url "http://mu.semte.ch/services/github/madnificent/book-service/books/")
:on-path "books")
```

Although you may not have written a letter of Common Lisp before, you will probably be able to understand the lines of code above.

- We define a book resource
- Each book will get schema:Book as RDF class
- Each book instance will be identified with a URI starting with ‚Äúhttp://mu.semte.ch/services/github/madnificent/book-service/books/‚Äù  ‚Äì mu-cl-resources just appends a generated UUID to it
- The resources will be published on the /books API endpoint

Finally, define the properties of a book:
```lisp
(in-package :mu-cl-resources)

(define-resource book ()
  :class (s-prefix "schema:Book")
  :properties `((:title :string ,(s-prefix "schema:headline"))
                (:isbn :string ,(s-prefix "schema:isbn"))
                (:publication-date :date ,(s-prefix "schema:datePublished"))
                (:genre :string ,(s-prefix "schema:genre"))
                (:language :string ,(s-prefix "schema:inLanguage")) 
                (:number-of-pages :integer ,(s-prefix "schema:numberOfPages")))
  :resource-base (s-url "http://mu.semte.ch/services/github/madnificent/book-service/books/")
:on-path "books")
```

Each property is described according to the format:

```lisp
(:dasherized-property-name :type, (s-prefix "my-prefix:my-predicate"))
```

and will result in a triple:
```
<http://mu.semte.ch/services/github/madnificent/book-service/books/ead2e61a-ab1e-4261-9b6d-9c142ae94765> my-prefix:my-predicate "some-value"
```

#### Configuring the dispatcher

Our book resources will be available on the /books paths. The mu-cl-resources service provides GET, POST, PATCH and DELETE operations on this path for free Assuming the books service is known as ‚Äòresource‚Äô in our dispatcher, we will add the following dispatch rule to our dispatcher configuration to forward the incoming requests to the books service:

```lisp
match "/books/*path" do
 Proxy.forward conn, path, "http://resource/books/"
end
```

Good job! The books can now be produced and consumed by the frontend through your JSONAPI compliant API. Now we will add relationships to the model.


#### The author model
Each book is written by (at least one) an author. An author isn‚Äôt a regular property of a book like - for example - the book‚Äôs title. It's a resource on its own. An author has its own properties like a name, a birth date etc. And it is related to a book. Before we can define the relationship between books and authors, we first need to specify the model of an author.

The definition of the model is very similar to that of the book. Add the following lines to your `domain.lisp`:

```lisp
(define-resource author ()
  :class (s-prefix "schema:Author")
  :properties `((:name :string ,(s-prefix "schema:name"))
                (:given-name :string ,(s-prefix "foaf:givenName"))
                (:family-name :string ,(s-prefix "foaf:familyName")))
  :resource-base (s-url "http://mu.semte.ch/services/github/madnificent/book-service/authors/")
:on-path "authors")
```

Expose the author endpoints in the `dispatcher.ex` configuration:
```
match "/authors/*path" do
  Proxy.forward conn, path, "http://resource/authors/"
end
```

#### Defining relationships
Now that the author model is added, we can define the relationship between a book and an author. Let‚Äôs suppose a one-to-many relationship. A book has one author and an author may have written multiple books.

First, extend the book‚Äôs model:
```lisp
(define-resource book ()
  :class (s-prefix "schema:Book")
  :properties `((:title :string ,(s-prefix "schema:headline"))
                (:isbn :string ,(s-prefix "schema:isbn"))
                (:publication-date :date ,(s-prefix "schema:datePublished"))
                (:genre :string ,(s-prefix "schema:genre"))
                (:language :string ,(s-prefix "schema:inLanguage")) 
                (:number-of-pages :integer ,(s-prefix "schema:numberOfPages")))
  :has-one `((author :via ,(s-prefix "schema:author") 
              :as "author"))
  :resource-base (s-url "http://mu.semte.ch/services/github/madnificent/book-service/books/")
:on-path "books")
```

Adding an author to a book will now result in the following triple in the store:
```
<http://mu.semte.ch/services/github/madnificent/book-service/books/182232da-e07d-438f-8608-f6356624a666> 
    schema:author <http://mu.semte.ch/services/github/madnificent/book-service/authors/e6c446ad-36ee-43b3-a8a0-2349ecfdcb5d> .
```

The :as ‚Äúauthor‚Äù portion of the definition specifies the path on which the relationship will be exposed in the JSON representation of a book.

```json
{
  "attributes": {
    "title": "Rock & Roll with Ember"
  },
  "id": "620f7a1c-9d31-4b8a-a627-2eb6904fe1f3",
  "type": "books",
  "relationships": {
     "author": {
       "links": {
         "self": "/books/620f7a1c-9d31-4b8a-a627-2eb6904fe1f3/links/author",
         "related": "/books/620f7a1c-9d31-4b8a-a627-2eb6904fe1f3/author"
       }
     }
  }
}
```

Next, add the inverse relationship to the author‚Äôs model:

```lisp
(define-resource author ()
  :class (s-prefix "schema:Author")
  :properties `((:name :string ,(s-prefix "schema:name")))
  :has-many `((book :via (s-prefix "schema:author")
               :inverse t
               :as "books"))
  :resource-base (s-url "http://mu.semte.ch/services/github/madnificent/book-service/authors/")
:on-path "authors")
```

The ‚Äò:inverse t‚Äô indicates that the relationship from author to books is the inverse relation. As you can see the the relationship‚Äôs path ‚Äúbooks‚Äù is in plural since it‚Äôs a has-many relation in this case.

If you want to define a many-to-many relationships between books and authors, just change the :has-one to :has-many and pluralize the ‚Äúauthor‚Äù path to ‚Äúauthors‚Äù in the book‚Äôs model. Don‚Äôt forget to restart your microservice if you‚Äôve updated the model.

Now simply restart your microservice by running `docker-compose restart`, and you're done!

#### Conclusion
That's it! Now you can [fetch](http://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-relationships) and [update](http://jsonapi.org/format/#crud-updating-relationships) the relationships as specified by [jsonapi.org](http://jsonapi.org/).  The generated API also supports the [include query parameter](http://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-includes) to include related resources in the response when fetching one or more resource. That‚Äôs a lot you get for just a few lines of code, isn‚Äôt it?

### Adding an ember UI to your project
This tutorial builds on the [previous one](#creating-a-json-api) to add a UI to manage books using [EmberJS](https://www.emberjs.com/).

#### Ember in the frontend

Our end-users access the services through EmberJS application.  This provides us with an integrated, styled and flexible view of the enabled microservices.  We‚Äôll create a new ember application to allow end-users to list, create, and delete authors.  The advised way to build and develop EmberJS applications is using ember-cli.

You can install ember-cli by following the instructions on [the emberjs website](https://cli.emberjs.com/), or you can keep everything in docker using the [ember-docker scripts](https://github.com/madnificent/docker-ember).  Our examples assume you‚Äôll use ember-docker, which provides the `edi` and `eds` commands. If you're using a globally installed ember-cli, simply remove `edi` from any commands and replace `eds` with `ember serve`.

#### Build a new app

First we create the new application.  The command is short, but it may take a while to fetch all NPM dependencies.  Grab a coffee while the computer works for you.

```sh
edi ember new books
# Or if using a globally installed ember-cli (see above)
# ember new books
```

#### Live reloading changes

Let‚Äôs see if our new application runs.  Go into the books directory and run the ember serve command (available as eds).  Once the files have compiled, you can visit the site in your browser at localhost:4200.

```sh
cd books
eds --proxy http://host # alt: ember serve --proxy http://localhost:80/
```

The proxy connects to our localhost on port 80 (yes, it‚Äôs called host in the ember-docker, rather than localhost).  We‚Äôll use this later to fetch content from the microservices.  Let‚Äôs alter the title of our application, the browser‚Äôs view will update automatically.  Open app/application.hbs and change the following:

```diff
- {{!-- The following component displays Ember's default welcome message. --}}
- {{welcome-page}}
- {{!-- Feel free to remove this! --}}
+  <h2 id="title">My books</h2>
```

Boom, automatic updates in the browser.

#### Connecting

EmberJS applications roughly follow the Web-MVC pattern.  The applications have a rigid folder-structure, most content being in the app folder.  Ember-cli uses generators to generate basic stubs of content. Since the APIs we're using follow the json-api specification, we can avoid writing custom adapter and serialiser code by simply generating default ones for our application to use if a specific one is not specified:

```sh
edi ember generate adapter application
edi ember generate serializer application
```

We create the books model, route and controller using ember-cli.  Check the helpers for ember generate model, ember generate route and ember generate controller, or the following:

```sh
edi ember generate model book title:string isbn:string
edi ember generate route books
edi ember generate controller books
```

The terminal output shows the created and updated files.  (note: generating new files can make watched files fail in Docker, just kill and restart eds should that happen.)

We will fetch all books and render them in our template.  In routes/books.js:

```diff
=  import Route from '@ember/routing/route';
+  import { inject as service } from '@ember/service';
=
=  export default class BooksRoute extends Route {
+    @service store;
+
+    model() {
+      return this.store.findAll('book');
+    }
=  }
```

We‚Äôll display the found records in our template so we‚Äôre able to see the created records later on.  Add the following to templates/books.hbs

```diff
+  <ul>
+    {{#each @model as |book|}}
+      <li>
+        {{book.title}} <small>{{book.isbn}}</small>
+      </li>
+    {{/each}}
+  </ul>
```

#### Creating new books

We‚Äôll add a small input-form through which we can create new books at the bottom of our listing.  Two input fields and a create button will suffice for our example.

In the app/templates/book.hbs template, we‚Äôll add our create fields and button:

```diff
+  <hr />
+ <form {{on "submit" this.createBook}} >
+   <dl>
+     <dt>Book title</dt>
+     <dd>
+        <Input @value={{this.newTitle}}
+               placeholder="Thinking Fast and Slow" />
+     </dd>
+     <dt>ISBN</dt>
+     <dd>
+       <Input @value={{this.newIsbn}}
+              placeholder="978-0374533557" />
+     </dd>
+   </dl>
+   <button type="submit">Create</button>
+ </form>
```

We‚Äôll add this action in the controller and make it create the new book.  In app/controllers/books.js add the following:

```diff
=  import Controller from '@ember/controller';
+  import { action } from '@ember/object';
+  import { tracked } from '@glimmer/tracking';
+  import { inject as service } from '@ember/service';
=
-  export default class BooksController extends Controller {}
+  export default class BooksController extends Controller {
+    @tracked newTitle = '';
+    @tracked newIsbn = '';
+
+    @service store;
+
+    @action
+    createBook(event) {
+      event.preventDefault();
+      // create the new book
+      const book = this.store.createRecord('book', {
+        title: this.newTitle,
+        isbn: this.newIsbn,
+      });
+      book.save();
+      // clear the input fields
+      this.newTitle = '';
+      this.newIsbn = '';
+    }
+  });
```

#### Removing books

Removing books follows a similar path to creating new books.  We add a delete button to the template, and a delete action to the controller.

In app/templates/book.hbs we alter:

```diff
=    <li>
=      {{book.title}}<small>{{book.isbn}}</small>
+      <button type="button" {{on "click" (fn this.removeBook book)}}>Remove</button>
=    </li>
```

In app/controllers/books.js we alter:

```diff
=      this.newTitle = '';
=      this.newIsbn = '';
=    }
+
+    @action
+    removeBook(book, event) {
+      event.preventDefault();
+      book.destroyRecord();
+    }
=  }
```

### Adding authentication to your mu-project
![](http://mu.semte.ch/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/customumize_for_user-1024x768.png)

Web applications oftentimes require a user to be authenticated to access (part of) their application. For example a webshop may require a user to be logged in before placing an order. In a previous blog post we already explained [the semantic model to represent logged in users](https://mu.semte.ch/2017/08/24/representing-logged-in-users/). In this post we will show how to enable authentication in your app. We assume you already have¬† a [mu-project](https://github.com/mu-semtech/mu-project) running, with an ember front-end project.

Adding authentication to your application consists of two tasks:

-   Adding registration so users can create a new account
-   Adding a login service so users can authenticate themselves

Both tasks require changes in the backend as well as in the frontend. Let‚Äôs start with the registration.

#### Registration

First, we will add registration to the project. The backend will be enriched with¬†a microservice to manage accounts. The frontend will be augmented with an¬†Ember addon providing components to¬†register, unregister and ¬†change a password.

##### In the backend

The [registration service](https://github.com/mu-semtech/registration-service) provides a service to create new accounts with a nickname and a password. To integrate the service in your project, add the following snippet to the `docker-compose.yml`.
```yaml
registration:
  image: semtech/mu-registration-service:2.6.0
  links:
    - database:database
```

(Re)start the project.
```bash
docker-compose up
```
Next, configure the following routes in your dispatcher configuration in `config/dispatcher/dispatcher.ex`.
```ex
match "/accounts/\*path" do
  Proxy.forward conn, path, "http://registration/accounts/"
end
```

Restart the dispatcher service .
```bash
docker-compose restart dispatcher
```

From now on all requests starting with ‚Äò/accounts‚Äô will be forwarded to the registration service.

##### In the frontend

We now have an endpoint for registration in the backend. We need a complementary component¬†in the frontend that provides a GUI to¬†communicate with this backend. ¬†This component is offered by the [ember-mu-registration](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ember-mu-registration) addon.

First, install the addon by executing the following command in your Ember project.
```bash
ember install ember-mu-registration
ember install ember-resolver
```

Next, just include the `{{mu-register}}`, `{{mu-unregister}}` and `{{mu-change-password}}` component in your template.

```hbs
{{!-- app/templates/registration.hbs --}}
<MuRegister />
```

The components will automatically send the correct requests to the backend. You can customize the component‚Äôs template and/or behavior as explained in the addon‚Äôs [README](https://github.com/mu-semtech/ember-mu-registration#advanced-usage).

Finally create a new user account through the newly added mu-register component. We can use this user to validate the login in the next step.

#### Login
Users can now create a new account, but how can they authenticate themselves in the app? In the next step we will enrich the backend with a login microservice and the frontend with a login form and a logout button.

##### In the backend
The [login service](https://github.com/mu-semtech/login-service) provides a service¬†to associate a session with a user‚Äôs account if the correct user credentials are provided. Have a look at [the semantic works docs](https://github.com/Denperidge-Redpencil/project/blob/master/docs/references/representing-logged-in-users.md) if you want to know the semantic model behind the users, sessions and accounts. To integrate the service in your project, add the following snippet to the `docker-compose.yml`.
```yaml
login:
  image: semtech/mu-login-service:2.8.0
  links:
    - database:database
```

(Re)start the project.
```bash
docker-compose up
```

Next, configure the following routes in your dispatcher configuration in `config/dispatcher/dispatcher.ex`.
```ex
match "/sessions/\*path" do
  Proxy.forward conn, path, "http://login/sessions/"
end
```

Restart the dispatcher service .
```bash
docker-compose restart dispatcher
```

From now on all requests starting with ‚Äò/sessions‚Äô will be forwarded to the login service.

#### In the frontend
Users can now be authenticated in the backend. Next, we need GUI components to login and logout and a mechanism to protect parts of the application so they are only accessible by authenticated users. These components are offered by the [ember-mu-login addon](https://github.com/mu-semtech/ember-mu-login) which requires [ember-simple-auth](https://github.com/simplabs/ember-simple-auth) to be installed, too.

First, install the addons by executing the following commands in your Ember project.
```bash
ember install ember-simple-auth
ember install ember-mu-login
```

##### Login form
Next, we will generate a login route with a login form where the user can enter his credentials to authenticate.
```bash
ember generate route login
```

Add the `mu-login` component to the template.
```hbs
{{!-- app/templates/login.hbs --}}

{{mu-login}}
```

##### Logout button
Once the user logged in, we will show a button so the user can logout. We will use [ember-simple-auth‚Äôs ‚ÄòisAuthenticated‚Äô property](https://github.com/simplabs/ember-simple-auth#basic-usage) to check the current session‚Äôs state. The session service needs to be injected in the application controller.

```js
// app/controllers/application.js
import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Controller.extend({
  session: Ember.inject.service('session')

  // ‚Ä¶
});
```

Next, update the application‚Äôs template to show the logout button if the user is authenticated.
```hbs
{{!-- app/templates/application.hbs --}}
{{#if session.isAuthenticated}}
  {{mu-logout}}
{{/if}}
```

Finally, mix the `ApplicationRouteMixin` in your application‚Äôs route. This mixin will automatically handle the [authenticationSucceeded](http://ember-simple-auth.com/api/classes/SessionService.html#event_authenticationSucceeded) and [invalidationSucceeded](http://ember-simple-auth.com/api/classes/SessionService.html#event_invalidationSucceeded) events.

```js
// app/routes/application.js
import Ember from 'ember';
import ApplicationRouteMixin from 'ember-simple-auth/mixins/application-route-mixin';

export default Ember.Route.extend(ApplicationRouteMixin);
```

##### Protecting routes

Users can now login in the application, but they are still able to access all pages regardless whether they are authenticated or not. To make a route in the application accessible only when the session is authenticated, mix the [AuthenticatedRouteMixin](http://ember-simple-auth.com/api/classes/AuthenticatedRouteMixin.html) into the respective route:
```js
// app/routes/protected.js
import Ember from 'ember';
import AuthenticatedRouteMixin from 'ember-simple-auth/mixins/authenticated-route-mixin';

export default Ember.Route.extend(AuthenticatedRouteMixin);
```

This will make the route (and all of its subroutes) transition to the ‚Äòlogin‚Äô route if the session is not authenticated.

#### Finished
And that's it! Now you know how your mu-project can be easily augmented with authentication using a custom user registration service.

### Building a mail handling service
My goal for this short coding session is to have a mail handling service that will allow me to list and manipulate mails through a JSON:API REST back-end. And have that service pick up when I write a mail to the database and send it automatically. You can see the result of this project at https://github.com/langens-jonathan/ReactiveMailServiceExample.

#### Gain a head-start with mu-project
For this project I started with cloning the mu-project repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mu-semtech/mu-project
```

This will give me the CRUD endpoint I need to manipulate my mail related resources. After cloning I rename the repository to MailBox and set the remote origin to a new one. For now I will leave the `README.md` file as it is.

For the first block we will modify the `config/resources/domain.lisp`, `config/resourecs/repository.lisp` and the `config/dispatcher/dispatcher.ex` files.

To add the necessary resource definitions, add them to the `domain.lisp` file as follows:

```lisp
(define-resource mail ()
   :class (s-prefix "example:Mail")
   :properties `((:sender :string ,(s-prefix "example:sender"))
                 (:subject :string ,(s-prefix "example:subject"))
                 (:content :string ,(s-prefix "example:content"))
                 (:ready :string ,(s-prefix "example:ready")))
   :resource-base (s-url "http://example.com/mails/")
   :on-path "mails")
```

This will create a resource description that we can manipulate on route `/mails` with the properties sender, title, body and ready.

Then add the prefix to the `repository.lisp` file:

```lisp
 (add-prefix "example" "http://example.com/")
```

We are almost there for a first test! The only thing left to do is to add the `/mails` route to the dispatcher (for more info check the documentation on http://mu.semte.ch). To do this add the following block of code to the `dispatcher.ex` file:

```
match "/mails/*path" do
  Proxy.forward conn, path, "http://resource/mails/"
end
```

Now fire this up and lets see what we have by running the following command in the project root directory:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

*Note: We don‚Äôt have a front-end, but with a tool like postman we can make GET, PATCH and POST calls to test the backend functionality.*

A GET call to http://localhost/mails produces:
```json
{
  "data": [],
  "links": {
    "last": "/mails/",
    "first": "/mails/",
    "self": "mails"
  }
}
```

Alright! Ok, no data yet, but we get back resource information.

Lets do a post request to make a new mail resource:

```conf
URL: http://localhost/mails
Headers: {"Content-Type":"application/vnd.api+json"}
Body:
  {
    "data":{
      "attributes":{
        "sender":"flowofcontrol@gmail.com",
        "subject":"Mu Semtech Mail Server",
        "content":"This is a test for the Mu Semtech Mail Server.",
        "ready":"no"
      },
      "type":"mails"
    }
  }
```

This gives us the following reponse:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "attributes": {
      "sender": "flowofcontrol@gmail.com",
      "subject": "Mu Semtech Mail Server",
      "content": "This is a test for the Mu Semtech Mail Server.",
      "ready": "no"
    },
    "id": "58978C2A6460170009000001",
    "type": "mails",
    "relationships": {}
  }
}
```

That worked! In about 30 minutes we have a fully functional REST API endpoint for managing mail resources!

To verify the original get request again, this now produces:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "attributes": {
      "sender": "flowofcontrol@gmail.com",
      "subject": "Mu Semtech Mail Server",
      "content": "This is a test for the Mu Semtech Mail Server.",
      "ready": "no"
    },
    "id": "58978C3A6460170009000002",
    "type": "mails",
    "relationships": {}
   }
}
```

#### Enabling the reactive database
Before we can start writing our reactive mail managing micro-service, we will need to add a monitoring service to monitor the DB. This will be a lot easier than it sounds with mu.semte.ch. To start, open the `docker-compose.yml` file and add the following lines at the bottom of the file:

```yaml
# ...
delta:
  image: semtech/mu-delta-service:beta-0.7
  links:
    - database:database
  volumes:
    - ./config/delta-service:/config
  environment:
    CONFIGFILE: "/config/config.properties"
    SUBSCRIBERSFILE: "/config/subscribers.json"
```

This will add the monitoring service to our installation. The last thing to do for now is to change the link on the `resource` microservice by replacing
```yaml
links:
  - database:database
```
with
```yaml
links:
  - delta:database
```

The final steps are to create the configuration and subscribers files. Create a file called `config.properties` at the location `config/delta-service/config.properties` and write the following lines in that file:

```conf
# made by Langens Jonathan
queryURL=http://database:8890/sparql
updateURL=http://database:8890/sparql
sendUpdateInBody=true
calculateEffectives=true
```

and then create `config/delta-service/subscribers.json` and put this JSON inside:

```json
{
  "potentials":[
  ],
  "effectives":[
  ]
}
```

If we run `docker-compose rm` and then `docker-compose up` again, the delta service will be booting and already monitoring the changes that happen in the database! Of course we are not doing anything with them yet. So we will create a new micro-service just for this purpose.

#### The mail-fetching microservice
The next step is to build our mail handling microservice. To do this we create a new directory called `mail-service` in our base directory. Then we create a file in that directory called `Dockerfile`. We will start from a mu.semte.ch template to make developing this microservice that much quicker. Mu.semte.ch has templates for a bunch of languages ruby, javascript, python, ‚Ä¶ For this microservice we will go for python 2.7. To do this we simply need to create a `web.py` file which will serve as the location for our code. Next add the following to the Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
# mail-service/Dockerfile
FROM semtech/mu-python-template

MAINTAINER Langens Jonathan <flowofcontrol@gmail.com>
```

I know it doesn‚Äôt say much, but it doesn‚Äôt need to. The python template will handle the rest.

Then we need to add some mail manipulating functionality. Since this is not really the objective of this post I create a `mail_helpers.py` file and paste the following code in there:
```python
# mail-service/mail_helpers.py
import sys
import imaplib
import getpass
import email
import datetime
import uuid
import helpers

def save_mail(sender, date, subject, content):
  str_uuid = str(uuid.uuid4())
  insert_query = "INSERT DATA\n{\nGRAPH <http://mu.semte.ch/application>\n{\n<http://mail.com/examples/mail/" + str_uuid + "> a <http://mail.com/Mail>;\n"
  insert_query += "<http://mail.com/from> \"" + sender + "\";\n"
  insert_query += "<http://mail.com/date> \"" + date + "\";\n"
  insert_query += "<http://mail.com/content> \"" + content + "\";\n"
  insert_query += "<http://mail.com/subject> \"" + subject + "\";\n"
  insert_query += "<http://mu.semte.ch/vocabularies/core/uuid> \"" + str_uuid + "\".\n"
  insert_query += "}\n}"
  print "query:\n", insert_query
  helpers.update(insert_query)

def process_mailbox(mailbox):
  rv, data = mailbox.search(None, "ALL")
  if rv != 'OK':
    print "No messages found!"
  return

  for num in data[0].split():
    rv, data = mailbox.fetch(num, '(RFC822)')
    if rv != 'OK':
      print "ERROR getting message", num
    return
  
    msg = email.message_from_string(data[0][1])
    content = str(msg.get_payload())
    content = content.replace('\n','')

    save_mail(msg['From'], msg['Date'], msg['Subject'], content)
```

As you can see the mail_helpers contain 2 functions, one to iterate over all emails in a mailbox and the other to save a single email to the triple store. Easy peasy!

Next we create `web.py`. For more information on how the python template can be used you can visit: https://github.com/mu-semtech/mu-python-template. I created the following method to process all mails:
```python
# mail-service/web.py
@app.route("/fetchMails")
def fetchMailMethod():
  EMAIL_ADDRESS = "address"
  EMAIL_PWD = "pwd"

  MAIL_SERVER = imaplib.IMAP4_SSL('imap.gmail.com')

  try:
    MAIL_SERVER.login(EMAIL_ADDRESS, EMAIL_PWD)
    except imaplib.IMAP4.error:
     print "Logging into mailbox failed! "

  rv, data = MAIL_SERVER.select("INBOX")
  if rv == 'OK':
    mail_helpers.process_mailbox(MAIL_SERVER)
    MAIL_SERVER.close()

  MAIL_SERVER.logout()

  return "ok"
```

This method is rather straightforward: it just opens a connection to an email address and opens the inbox mailbox. It then selects it for processing, thus inserting all mails into the triple store.

At this point, we have:
- Defined a JSONAPI through which we can access our emails, using the standard mu.semte.ch stack
- Built a custom service which fetches the emails from our mail account and inserts them into the triplestore using the right model

Now we will use these services in combination with the delta service, to discover which emails were inserted into the database, and to perform reactive computations on it.

#### The delta service

The delta service‚Äôs responsibilities are:

- Acting as the SPARQL endpoint for the microservices
- Calculating the differences (deltas) that a query will introduce in the database
- Notifying interested parties of these differences

For this hands on we use version beta-0.8 of the delta service.

##### What do these delta reports look like?
There are 2 types of delta reports, you have potential inserts and effective inserts. A report for either will look like:
```json
{
  "delta": [
    {
      "type": "effective",
      "graph": "http://mu.semte.ch/application",
      "inserts": [
        {
          "s": {
            "value": "http://example.com/mails/58B187FA6AA88E0009000001",
            "type": "uri"
          },
          "p": {
            "value": "http://example.com/subject",
            "type": "uri"
          },
          "o": {
            "value": "Mu Semtech Mail Server",
            "type": "literal"
          }
        },
       ...
}
```
*You can view the full version [here](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/langens-jonathan/cd5db8e9f68861662d888dad77f93662/raw/84adc69f9fd3143f45c05c0a5cefdf1ca9b95b55/gistfile1.txt).*

A report states the query that was sent, an array of inserted objects and an array of deleted objects: Inserted or deleted objects represent a single triple with s, p and o being subject, predicate and object.

#### Expanding our mail handling microservice
We need to notify the delta service of the existence of our mail handling service. We do this using the `subscribers.json` file that was created before. Change it so it looks like:

```json
{
  "potentials":[
  ],
    "effectives":[
    "http://mailservice/process_delta"
  ]
}
```

In the `docker-compose.yml` file we need to alter the delta-service definition to look like:

```yaml
  delta:
    image: semtech/mu-delta-service:beta-0.8
    links:
      - database:database
      - mailservice:mailservice
    volumes:
      - ./config/delta-service:/config
    environment:
      CONFIGFILE: "/config/config.properties"
      SUBSCRIBERSFILE: "/config/subscribers.json"
```

That way the delta service can talk to the mailservice.

To handle delta reports in our mail handling microservice we will need 2 things:

- Get access to the POST body of a request
- Process and manipulate JSON data

To get access to this add the following imports to your `web.py` file:

```python
import json
from flask import request
```

Then we define a new method that will:
- Handle the incoming delta reports
- Load the delta report into a variable
- Define some variables.

Lastly we define an array that will hold the URI‚Äôs of all emails that need to be sent.


```python
# mail-service/web.py
@app.route("/process_delta", methods=['POST'])
def processDelta():
  delta_report = json.loads(request.data)
  mails_to_send = set()
  predicate_mail_is_ready = "http://example.com/ready"
  value_mail_is_ready = "yes"
  # continued later...
```

We will loop over all inserted triples to check for mails that are ready to be sent:
```python
# mail-service/web.py
def processDelta():
  # ...
  # ...continuation
  for delta in delta_report['delta']:
      for triple in delta['inserts']:
          if(triple['p']['value'] == predicate_mail_is_ready):
              if(triple['o']['value'] == value_mail_is_ready):
                  mails_to_send.add(triple['s']['value'])
  # continued later...
```

After this for loop has run, all the URI‚Äôs of mails that are ready to be send will be in the `mails_to_send` array. Now we loop over the array and query the database for each URI in the set. And then we will fetch a mail object for every URI that is in the set.

Add the following code to `mail_helpers.py`:
```python
# mail-service/mail_helpers.py
def load_mail(uri):
    # this query will find the mail (if it exists)
    select_query = "SELECT DISTINCT ?uuid ?from ?ready ?subject ?content\n"
    select_query += "WHERE \n{\n"
    select_query += "<" + str(uri) + "> <http://mail.com/from> ?from;\n"
    select_query += "a <http://mail.com/Mail>;\n"
    select_query += "<http://mail.com/content> ?content;\n"
    select_query += "<http://mail.com/subject> ?subject;\n"
    select_query += "<http://mail.com/ready> ?ready;\n"
    select_query += "<http://mu.semte.ch/vocabularies/core/uuid> ?uuid.\n"
    select_query += "}"

    # execute the query...
    result = helpers.query(select_query)

    # if the length of the result array is 0 we return nil
    if len(result['results']['bindings']) < 1:
        return {}

    # I should probably check here but for a quick test application
    # it doesn't matter that much. If there is more than 1 result
    # that would indicate a data error
    bindings = result['results']['bindings'][0]

    # we extract an object
    mail = dict()
    mail['uuid'] = bindings['uuid']['value']
    mail['sender'] = bindings['from']['value']
    mail['ready'] = bindings['ready']['value']
    mail['subject'] = bindings['subject']['value']
    mail['content'] = bindings['content']['value']

    return mail
```

This function will load the mail object from the triple store. There is still the chance that the ready predicate was sent for some other object, for a mail that does not have all required fields, or for an object that is not a mail but happens to use the same predicate.

We will use this function to try to load a mail object for each URI. Because the query was built without OPTIONAL statements, we are certain that an the dictionary returned by the load_mail function will either have all keys or none.

To send the mail I have copied the entire `send_mail` function from http://naelshiab.com/tutorial-send-email-python/ and modified it slightly to take into account the dictionary object that now describes the mail.

```python
# mail-service/mail_helpers.py
def send_mail(mail):

    fromaddr = "YOUR EMAIL"
    toaddr = "EMAIL ADDRESS YOU SEND TO"

    msg = MIMEMultipart()

    msg['From'] = mail['from']
    msg['To'] = mail['to']
    msg['Subject'] = mail['subject']

    body = mail['content']
    msg.attach(MIMEText(body, 'plain'))

    server = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', 587)
    server.starttls()
    server.login(fromaddr, "YOUR PASSWORD")
    text = msg.as_string()
    server.sendmail(fromaddr, toaddr, text)
    server.quit()
```

The last thing that we need to do is to connect the list of URI‚Äôs to the send_mail function:
```python
# mail-service/web.py
def processDelta():
  # ...continuation
    for uri in mails_to_send:
        mail = mail_helpers.load_mail(uri)
        if 'uuid' in mail.keys():
            mail_helpers.send_mail(mail, EMAIL_ADDRESS, EMAIL_PWD)
```

To test this you can send a POST request similar to this one to your local mu.semte.ch application on http://localhost/mails:

```json
{"data":{
  "attributes":{
    "from":"flowofcontrol@gmail.com",
    "subject":"A mail from the triple store",
    "content":"This mail was sent by a micro service that listens to your triple store.",
    "ready":"yes",
    "to":"flowofcontrol@gmail.com"
    },
 "type":"mails"
 }
}
```

If all went well then the person whose email address you filled in in the to field will have gotten a mail from you. Good job! You've just created a mailing microservice.

### Adding Ember FastBoot to your project

![](http://mu.semte.ch/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/kuifje_op_de_maan-248x300.png)
In this post, we‚Äôre going elaborate a little on how to add Ember FastBoot to your mu-project. This should not be considered as a full blown tutorial, but rather as a set of notes to get you started.

In a nutshell, Ember FastBoot¬†introduces server side rendering on your ember app, which should not only improve user experience by serving static content first, but also make your website more SEO friendly. For more info, I would recommend you to check out [https://ember-fastboot.com/](https://ember-fastboot.com/).

#### Setting the scene
All right, let‚Äôs get started. Assume you‚Äôre writing the new blogging app, called ‚Äúmu-fastboot-example‚Äù.  
It has a very simple data model with two entities. A blog post, which has a title, content, an author and many comments. ¬†You can find the definition [here](https://github.com/cecemel/mu-fastboot-example-backend/blob/master/config/resources/domain.lisp).¬†The backend needs a frontend of course and this has been published [here](https://github.com/cecemel/mu-fastboot-example-frontend).

Assume for now, we only need an index page, which displays an overview of the current posts along with the number of comments to this post, and the authors of the comments. ¬†A blog-post-summary component was created and ¬†its template¬†may be found [here](https://github.com/cecemel/mu-fastboot-example-frontend/blob/master/app/templates/components/blog-post-summary.hbs).

Firing up both frontend and backend, your home page would look like this.

![](http://mu.semte.ch/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-23-at-13.48.46-226x300.png)

Fetching your index page with a JavaScript disabled client, like e.g. curl, results in a totally SEO unfriendly, user unfriendly blank page, which waits till all resources are loaded before showing something.

#### Adding FastBoot

As [https://ember-fastboot.com/docs/user-guide#architecture](https://ember-fastboot.com/docs/user-guide#architecture) will tell you, two components are involved: the ember addon fastboot, and the application server itself, which will pre-prender your app.  
Installing fast boot add on is as simple as typing:
```bash
  ember install ember-cli-fastboot
```

The nice thing is, locally, you can immediately test the result of adding fastboot. Type
```bash
  ember fastboot
```
And to see the result (on port 3000):

```bash
  curl localhost:3000 
```
 
```hbs
  <!-- snippet from the initial html page -->
  <div id="ember981" class="ember-view"><h3> Another even better post</h3>
  by cecemel.
  <p> Celebrating the voidness! </p>
  <p>comments: 0</p>
  <p> comment authors: <!----> </p>
  <!-- end snippet -->`
```

#### caveats

There is still an issue. As you might have noticed, ¬†the second blog post doesn‚Äôt contain any comments or any comment authors.  
This because, FastBoot decides returning the page to the client, once the _model()_ hook resolves (or _beforeModel(), afterModel()_).  
If there is a component making an asynchronous call, e.g. counting the comments for each post, FastBook won‚Äôt consider this .  
The trick is, to make sure these async calls are resolved before, the _model()_ hook is resolved. You could change¬†_app/routes/index.js_¬† e.g. to the following:

```js
    import Ember from 'ember';
    
    export default Ember.Route.extend({
        fastboot: Ember.inject.service(),
        model() {
            if (this.get('fastboot.isFastBoot')) {
                return this.store.findAll('blog-post', {include: "comments"});
            }
            return this.store.findAll('blog-post');
        }
    });
```

This result of this change, can be seen immediately:
```bash
  curl localhost:3000
```
 
```hbs
  <!-- snippet from the initial html page -->
  <div id="ember981" class="ember-view"><h3> Another even better post</h3>
  by cecemel.
  <p> Celebrating the voidness! </p>
  <p>comments: 2 </p>
  <p> comment authors: An anonymous stranger  A popular blogger <!----> </p>
  <!-- end snippet -->
```

Unfortunately, this makes FastBoot a little less transparent then one would have initially hoped for. More information may be found at [FastBoot](https://ember-fastboot.com/docs/user-guide#use-model-hooks-to-defer-rendering).

#### Deploying

FastBoot has some nice deploy possibilities such as with AWS and Heroku, but in our case, we‚Äôll go for the [custom server](https://ember-fastboot.com/docs/deploying#custom-server). ¬†At the time of writing, the documentation is NOT up to date, ¬†and as an app server you should use, [fastboot-app-server](https://github.com/ember-fastboot/fastboot-app-server) instead of [fastboot](https://github.com/ember-fastboot/fastboot).

Just as with normal ember apps, in your app root, you build with
```bash
    ember build
```

which should, among the normal files, also create a `dist/fastboot/` folder.  
To host everything, you should follow the instructions described [here](https://github.com/ember-fastboot/fastboot-app-server).

FORTUNATELY, to ease the deploy, a [docker image](https://github.com/cecemel/ember-fastboot-proxy-service) has been created, which can easily be added to your mu-project, like e.g. [here](https://github.com/cecemel/mu-fastboot-example-backend/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) .

As usual, firing the project up with
```bash
    docker-compose stop; docker-compose rm -f; docker-compose up 
```
and you should have a working app.

So, that‚Äôs it. In case of questions, feel free to reach out.

### Adding a machine learning microservice to your mu.semte.ch project
In this post I want to explore how to add a machine learning microservice to any existing¬†[mu.semte.ch](http://mu.semte.ch/)¬†project. I want to be able to upload an image and add the labels for that image to the SPARQL store.

![](http://mu.semte.ch/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/docter-semtec-farious.png)

#### TensorFlow

TensorFlow‚Äôs inception library is great for image classification, it is a deep neural network that is trained to recognize objects. We can remove and retrain the outer layer easily (you can find a tutorial by Google on it). The microservice we will use wraps Inception and offers 3 routes:

-   Add-Training-Example: through this route you tell the system that a certain image file is of a certain label
-   Train: trains the model
-   Classify: takes an image file and adds the classification to the triple store

For an exisiting¬†[mu.semte.ch](http://mu.semte.ch/)¬†project you will probably want to add this microservice together with a trained graph and the use the classify route. While it is possible for a production system to learn, this may not be the best idea. Computers love to train, so they allocate all their computational resources to that, rather than keeping the rest smoothly running.

#### Mu-image-classifier demo
I have prepared¬†[a small example project](https://github.com/langens-jonathan/mu-image-classifier)¬†where you can see and test the classifier microservice. After you clone this it has no trained graph so the classify route will not work. The architecture of this demo app is as in the image below:  
![](http://mu.semte.ch/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/mu-image-classifier.png)

#### Train the model

So you have cloned the repository, cd in to the directory and type:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Open a browser and surf to [localhost](http://localhost).¬†Click on the training route. To train the model you have to add classes (min 2) and then add images for those classes. Be sure not to use any other image format than JPG. After you have prepared the training set you can click the ‚ÄúTrain‚Äù button. Your computer will be busy for a while now. If you need a more detailed tutorial on how to train there is one on the main page of the project you have just cloned, check the ‚Äò/‚Äô route!

![](http://mu.semte.ch/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screenshot-from-2017-08-01-09-49-06s.png)

#### Add the image classifier to a generic mu.semte.ch project
After you have a trained graph it is really as simple as adding the image classifier microservice to your¬†[mu.semte.ch](http://mu.semte.ch/)¬†project and all will work. The assumption is though that the vocabulary that is used to describe the files in your triple store is the one that is documented on the¬†[mu-file-service](https://github.com/mu-semtech/file-service).

Add this snippet to your docker-compose.yml:
```yml
classifier:
  image: flowofcontrol/mu-tf-image-classifier
  links:
    - database:database
  environment:
    CLASSIFIER_TRESHHOLD: 0.7
  volumes:
    - ./data/classifier/tf_files:/tf_files
    - ./data/classifier/images:/images
    - ./data/files:/files
  ports:
    - "6006:6006"
```


As you can see we include 3 folders and expose a port. On that port you can also make use of TensorBoard, which is TensorFlow‚Äôs administration board and that gives you access to all kind of statistics about our image classifier. Add this to your dispatcher (if you want to be able to retrain, you also have to add the other routes):
```ex
match "/classify/*path" do
  Proxy.forward conn, path, "http://classifier:5000/classify/"
end
```

The architecture of your app might then look somewhat like:  
![](http://mu.semte.ch/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/integrating_mu-image-classifier.png)

#### Classifying
If you then have an image you want to classify with it‚Äôs metadata correctly in the triple store then you can call the classify route and your image will be tagged.

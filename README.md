# mu-project

Bootstrap a mu.semte.ch microservices environment in three easy steps.

## Quickstart an mu-project

> [INFO]
> This project was created by running `mu project new awesome-project-name`.  If read on GitHub under mu-semtech/mu-project then it is the template repository for a new project, use `mu project new` instead.

Setting up your environment is done in three easy steps:
1. First configure the running microservices and their names in `docker-compose.yml`
2. Then, configure how requests are dispatched in `config/dispatcher.ex`
3. Lastly, simply start the docker-compose.

### Hooking things up with docker-compose

Alter the `docker-compose.yml` file so it contains all microservices you need.  The example content should be clear, but you can find more information in the [Docker Compose documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).  Don't remove the `identifier` and `db` container, they are respectively the entry-point and the database of your application.  Don't forget to link the necessary microservices to the dispatcher and the database to the microservices.

### Configure the dispatcher

Next, alter the file `config/dispatcher/dispatcher.ex` based on the example that is there by default.  Dispatch requests to the necessary microservices based on the names you used for the microservice.

### Boot up the system

Boot your microservices-enabled system using docker-compose.

    cd /path/to/mu-project
    docker-compose up

You can shut down using `docker-compose stop` and remove everything using `docker-compose rm`.

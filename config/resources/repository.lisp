;; You can use the ext: prefix when you're still searching for
;; the right predicates during development.  This should *not* be
;; used to publish any data under.  It's merely a prefix of which
;; the mu.semte.ch organisation indicates that it will not be used
;; by them and that it shouldn't be used for permanent URIs.
